Intro:
    The dfu-programmer is a Device Firmware Update based USB programmer for
Atmel chips with a USB programmer. Its function is comparable to the flip

The dfu programmer is dependent on libusb (version 1.0.8 with this install)
and libusb-compat (version 0.1.3 with this install). See the libusb site 
for more details:
